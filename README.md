Smart City Visualizer

This is a Unity project created by Yuxiang Zhang at CHORA, TU Berlin.
The project mainly uses Mapbox Unity SDK to generate city models.
Multiple layers of visualized information can be added on top of the city
and the app also receives grasshopper mesh model data for architecture project assessment.
